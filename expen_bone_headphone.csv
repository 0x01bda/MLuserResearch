James J.,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great for everything,2023年11月10日在美國評論,In construction i have to be able to hear the outside world and have a wonderful sounding quality bluetooth device to make calls and listen to music. The open ears allow just that.
Cintia,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,On Calls all day,2023年11月7日在美國評論,I work in sales and use these as my day to day headphones. I'm on calls all day and the air induction allows me to hear everything crystal clear.
Vickie,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,the design very cool and comfortable,2023年11月4日在美國評論,"The first reason i wanna buy this one, cuz i dont like in ear earbuds which not comfortable and painful.I tried this one when i jump or dance which don't fall, and i feel very comfortable. iThe second reason is that the price is very reasonable and  i really like the design."
Alicia E.,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great headphone,2023年11月4日在美國評論,"Great head phones. I love the over the ear style because they stay in better, especially when Im moving around."
Shouhui Yang,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,long-last sports earbuds,2023年11月4日在美國評論,"I've been using Apple AirPods Pro for a few years, but each time I charge them, they only work for a few hours and need frequent recharging. They are not very convenient for sports activities either. This time, after extensive research, I found these Open Air Buds. With one charge, they can work for 6-8 hours, and the charging case can last for almost a week. They are more convenient for sports. However, they are on the larger side and are more suitable for men. I highly recommend them with a five-star rating."
Bradley Cunningham,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Good sound and comfortable,2023年11月4日在美國評論,These headphones sit outside your ear but the sound is great and they are comfortable since they don’t enter your ears. Overall good headphones for comfort.
Amanda C.,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Wow,2023年11月4日在美國評論,"These sit outside of your ear, which takes some time to get used to, but the sound quality is amazing. My husband sitting next to me couldn't hear what I was listening to, but I heard it clearly."
john-,1.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,"Hard to operate, left bud did not work most of the time.",2023年11月3日在美國評論,"In a word; trash. The left side had worse sound and then did not connect half the time. As it was also the volume lessening button, it would consistently just keep lowering the volume without being pushed."

Kim Kerr,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great sound and so comfortable,2023年11月1日在美國評論,"I bought these for my husband, the music fanatic at our house. He loves them!  The sound is really good and the ear buds don’t go inside your ear so the are super comfy. My ears end up hurting after a while with my Apple earbuds so these are great when I’m able to borrow them.

Loralynn Buono,4.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,"changed my mind - ""waterproof for swimming"" earbuds that are ""not for swimming"".",2023年10月31日在美國評論,"Second review - I gave them a chance after receiving a second email retracting the ""not for swimming"" claim. I have been using them for a week and they are working just fine.First review _ The words ""waterproof for swimming"" are in the title and the first note is ""not for swimming"". What is wrong with your company ? I bought them FOR SWIMMING!!! Why are you advertising earbuds for swimming and then emailing me that they are NOT FOR SWIMMING. This is false advertising and I am going to report you. And of course I am returning your stupid  ""waterproof for swimming"" earbuds that are ""not for swimming""."
Night starA,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Perfect for my ears,2023年10月31日在美國評論,"Very comfortable to wear, suitable for my ears. And the voice quality is great, perfect for my daily use. I like to use it when I walking, it wouldn’t block other sounds."
Tas Kos,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Super excellent air-buds for the price,2023年10月31日在美國評論,"I recently got my hands on a pair of air-buds, and I can't help but share how thrilled I am with this fantastic purchase. These air-buds have truly elevated my listening experience to a whole new level.First and foremost, the sound quality is impeccable. The clarity, depth, and balance of the audio are astonishing, delivering a rich and immersive listening experience. Whether I'm enjoying music, podcasts, or taking calls, the audio quality is consistently outstanding.The comfort and fit of these air-buds are exceptional. They stay securely in my ears, even during workouts, and the sleek design is not only stylish but also comfortable for long listening sessions. The touch controls are intuitive and make using them a breeze.What's truly impressive is the battery life. These air-buds go the distance, providing hours of playback time on a single charge. It's incredibly convenient for people on the go or for those long commutes.The noise-canceling feature is a game-changer. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in my music or calls without any distractions.In summary, these air-buds are nothing short of excellent.

stephanie anderson,1.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Can’t swim with these,2023年10月31日在美國評論,"I bought these to wear while I swim laps. The description says “waterproof headphones for swimming. As soon as your head goes in the water, they instantly lose connection. Obviously not built for swimming. 0/10, do not recommend."

FS,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great sounding Over-Ear Headset,2023年10月30日在美國評論,"This review is for the Hyyeosd F15 Open Ear Bluetooth earbuds.  These individual earpieces with over-ear hooks do not fit inside your ear, rather the speakers float outside the ear canal.  It took me a while to get used to them as I have been using ""in-ear"" type headsets for years.The first thing you will notice is that the bass quality is not as pronounced as with in-ear buds.  You can't compare to buds that are pressed inside your ears. However,  in spite of this, the sound quality of music is excellent. I listened to a variety from instrumental, jazz, dance, and heavy metal and all delivered a clear, full range spectrum of sound.The fit is very comfortable and perfect for those that are bothered by in-ear buds. I did not use them during aerobic activity but they stayed on my ears just fine during routine activity.  You can hear your surroundings and music very clearly without having to turn volume up too high. Call quality was excellent with no issues even in environments with average noise, such as car, office, etc.The battery lasted at least 7 hours for me on one charge, using a mix of playing music and making calls.  The included charging case, about as slim as you can get for over-ears,  fits in your pocket without being too bulky. Packaging is nice and minimal, including a small USB C cable and comprehensive instructions.For those concerned about hearing damage with in-ear buds or want to hear their surroundings better while listening to music,  the F15 is an excellent option."
Darrell Locker,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,very good sound,2023年10月30日在美國評論,Connected to Galaxy phone very easily
Thomas Beales,1.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Failed after less than five hours of operation.,2023年10月29日在美國評論,"This is the second pair of waterproof phones I have purchased in the last six months.  Both inexpensive brands, both failed.  This pair failed after one week, when the power control button stopped working.  The sound was good, and initially I was happy with them, but this kind of simple control failure is ridiculous.  Will not buy again."
Kate Evans,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Love um,2023年10月28日在美國評論,"I love using these for running or on a plane! They work great for taking a phone call during a run, clear and the person on the other line understands well.  Great price I have them in three colors now!"

Torrance Guy,2.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Don't buy if you want to swim!,2023年10月27日在美國評論,"I purchased this product because it is advertised as waterproof and for use for swimming.  There is even pictures of the item in water and someone in a pool swimming wearing one!!!  Now I get notified via email that, ""The waterproof rating of this headset is only suitable for daily life, not for swimming, please do not use this headset for swimming.""  This is ridiculous and false advertising.This is fraud by selling the item for swimming and then saying not to use it for swimming!!!  What a ripoff."
Grecia Sanchez,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Best product,2023年10月27日在美國評論,"The best headset I have ever bought and I have bought several to fit my needs. The sound is perfect! I don’t even feel I have it on, very light weight. I LOVE IT!!!! Thank you for such a great product"

A. Reader,4.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Excellent earbuds for the price,2023年10月26日在美國評論,"I've been using these earbuds on and off for 10 days now, so I thought I would write a review.The first thing I noticed was the sound didn't seem to have the range that my old LG bluetooth headset had, but then they were twice the price of these. Was that headset twice as good as this one? Not at all. So these are excellent.In the 10 days that I've had them, I've only had to charge the base once, and then it was only when the charging level of the base was down to 70 or something. It was not down all the way.Speaking of the charging base, it's the only reason why I didn't give these 5 stars: there is no documentation about the base. Only after I had it plugged in for a few minutes did I realize that the number on the front was the percentage battery level of the charging base.I'm very pleased with this purchase."

Yina Yan,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,best bone conduction headphone 2023,2023年10月16日在美國評論,"The Hyyeosd Bone Conduction Headphones are certainly the best value of the bunch being more feature-rich than the others. Best for swimming as well as for land-based workouts, they come with its own MP3 player that stores 16GB's worth of music, which means that you don't have to rely on Bluetooth connectivity when you're in the water. Outside of the water, however, you still have that Bluetooth connectivity so you can stream any music or podcast you like.During my testing, they've also proven to be great for listening in general – a little bass-heavy, but rich-sounding overall in all modes. In the air, both music and podcasts sounded great and were surprisingly rich, whether streaming by Bluetooth or from the flash drive. Underwater, podcasts’ sound quality was just as good.The button controls are a little finnicky, so do take time to master and memorize them. However, that's only a very minor inconvenience and doesn't take away from the fact that these are the best bone conduction headphones right now.The sound quality is good here, if a little tinny, and better for podcasts than for music. Wearing the included earplugs do improve things a little bit, but they kind of beat the main purpose of these headphones. As for the controls, they're easy to use even with wet hands."

Lizzy W. R.,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,makes swimming more fun,2023年10月10日在美國評論,"I got into swimming a bit this summer, but always feel like my brain is a little bored when I'm in the pool. Got this so that I can listen to music or audiobooks! This makes workouts more fun for sure, and I actually end up staying in the water longer which is good for my health. The sound quality is good, and it's easy to use. No complaints so far!"

Amazon Customer,4.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great quality headphones for the price point!,2023年9月12日在美國評論,"My Beats earbuds would always fall out of my ears at the gym/while running and I had had enough. I purchased these because I wanted an easy, affordable solution and am happy with my choice.I picked these out of other over the ear Bluetooth headphones because they looked the least big in your ear. They fit really well and during my entire workout, I did not have to adjust my earbud at all.I agree with other reviews that the case was a bit big, but I just left it in the locker while I worked out and foresee myself not bringing out with me if I go running. Sound quality is good, but of course not the same as Beats or Sony quality. I also like that it displays the battery life so you know when they are ready for a charge.Overall, for the price point, would recommend!"

Keri Tanner,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Stays put!,2023年8月26日在美國評論,"These little ear buds came ready for use! I put them in in which they were comfortable! I wear these in bed when I want it to be quiet around me. I also will wear these when walking/ doing workouts! The sound quality is pretty good as well! The battery length is surprisingly long! You jusy charge the box they go in and when not in use, you put them up and they automatically charge! They connect as soon as you take them out and put them in as well! Super easy !

Harry,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Excellent Open Ear Buds!,2023年8月21日在美國評論,"Good for being aware of your surroundings while listening to music, books, videos, or podcasts. I've used many different wireless options but have never tried an open ear unit of this design. I tried open ear sunglasses but they weren't great. I was skeptical that the sounds would be terrible and volume would be too low, while also being too loud to others around you. I can confirm that the sound is actually very good. The crazy thing is you only hear the audio when they are an inch away from your ear. Other people cannot hear them.Wearing them took me a minute to figure out. If you just open them up and put them on your ears they don't seem secure. Eventually I figured out that there is a hinge that you open up when you pull them out of the case and then close them down when on your ear when you put them on.Battery life is very good and the charging case holds many charges. Charging the case is done through USB C. There is a display on the case for battery level. They turn on and connect when you take them out and they turn off when out then back in the case.  An important feature is the ability to just use one bud at a time, which these do support but I find I don't need to do that as I can still hear my surroundings. I was really impressed by these and definitely recommend!"

They are very comfortable and do not come off easily. My traditional earbuds were always falling out. This style works much better for me. They have great battery life as well. They charge quickly and are made well. Very durable. Great value for the cost. Makes a great gift."
Muddasir,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,It fits very comfortably on my ear,2023年8月19日在美國評論,I got this due to it’s amazing around the ear fitting even when I’m working out I don’t have to worry about it falling off. Also the battery life is very long lasting I charge it once a week max. Even though it’s not noice control you can barely hear anything from outside when they r put on and music is playing i definitely recommend it.
uguana11,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Good sound quality and stays snug in ears,2023年8月18日在美國評論,"I've used these headphones for a bit now, and have gone on a few runs with no issues having the sport buds fall out. It comes with a couple different size silicon cushions and I might have to test that out for improved comfort. The led battery indicator shows when the case is charged, and when the case is charging the headphones. The sound quality is good, but I'm admittedly not an audiophile, just someone that wants to listen to music while running."

Christina,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Great set very comfortable!,2023年8月11日在美國評論,"Great, excellent noise canceling, great for somebody who likes to listen to music loud even through earbuds. They are perfect. Absolutely perfect. Very fast charging didn’t take very long to charge to hundred percent at all and after listening to them for almost 6 hours throughout the day I was only down to 93%. The over the ear is very comfortable so these are very easy to wear for long periods of time. They hooked up to my iPhone very easily no issues and didn’t need directions. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants a solid set of earbuds!"

Shannon Hare,5.0 顆星，最高 5 顆星,Wireless Earbud Review,2023年8月11日在美國評論,"I ordered these wireless earbuds because I wanted earbuds that I wouldn’t have to worry about losing while I was working out or simply doing chores around the house. Let me tell you, there is no need to worry about them falling out. They stay on during the most rigorous of activities, even while playing sports.I also wanted earbuds that have a long battery life so I can listen to audiobooks while cleaning, cooking, and while doing other activities. These earbuds really fit the bill because they can be used for several hours before needing to recharge them. In addition, you can see how much battery life is remaining right on the charging case so that’s super helpful.I have not tested out their waterproof feature as of yet, so I can’t speak to that, but I can tell you that you won’t be disappointed if you purchase them. They have superior sound quality, are priced very affordably and they are super comfortable since the fit is customizable. I highly recommend these wireless earbuds."

I wanted to try something relatively inexpensive that can handle the all day use that she requires. Overall so far these headphones seem to work perfectly for listening to ebooks. She just listens using one headphones at the time. Overall. So far so good!
