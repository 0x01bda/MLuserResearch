Melissa,5,Great headphones,2023年10月16日在美國評論,"The fit is great, they don’t move at all during a run. Sound is great, connection is great"
Jacob Joyner,5,Nice,2023年10月15日在美國評論,Good product that fits nicely and is surprisingly loud yet comfortable.  Included charge cord is nice because companies seem to be skiking including those as of late to protect the environment but buying a replacement has even more packaging defeating the whole purpose and making a money grab.
VP ED Selector,5,Best headphones compared to in the ear styles,2023年10月15日在美國評論,"Excellent sounded and very user friendly, works great when working out and long walks"
JP,4,nice headphones,2023年10月14日在美國評論,nice headphones. would be better if they were adjustable in size. nice sound. easy to pair with phone.
Ollie,5,Love them so far,2023年10月13日在美國評論,"I LOVE these headphones. I struggle finding headphones that are comfortable to wear, and I won't lose them. Buds that go in the ear hurt, even with the smallest size inner ear piece, and other bones which I've tried, fall off easily. With these, they're discreet, I can still hear my surroundings (I don't like noise.cancelling) if I want to, I like the behind the neck design, and most importantly,  I can sleep with them on. I have headband flat headphones, but the wires on those go bad quickly. I have high hopes for the durability of these."
Chris,5,A safe way to listen to music while riding your bike,2023年10月13日在美國評論,They are comfortable and I don't have to worry about them falling off. Its convenient for when I ride my bike because I can pay attention to what's around me while having music playing without blocking out my hearing. This is not the product if your going for the best sound quality but it does have really good battery life. I use it everyday and it can last about 2 weeks on 1 charge.
s.rosario,5,Works Great,2023年10月12日在美國評論,Works great wish it had a little more volume.
Liquitta Doyle,3,Disconnects randomly,2023年10月12日在美國評論,Sounds great but it disconnects at random moments while in use even when fully charged.
Denesis & Pablo,5,Perfect,2023年10月11日在美國評論,I love the quality. I recommend it
Rorie,4,microphone not great but okay,2023年10月11日在美國評論,I like the sound well enough and it's certainly a good value.....
Peter Onah Thompson,4,It is sturdy and great,2023年10月11日在美國評論,"I love that it is sturdy and stays with me even when I forgot that I have it on it. My only concern and why I did not give a 5 star rating is the power of the Bluetooth. With my other headphone, I could leave my phone in the bedroom and move around the house with it and still be well connected. But with this one I could not. I start to loose connection the moment there seem to be a wall between me and my phone. Other than that, I have no complain at all."
THOMAS W RIES,5,Satisfied customer,2023年10月10日在美國評論,surprisingly comfortable and easy usage
Rahsaan Bailey-King,1,Product is not water proof or even water resistant,2023年10月9日在美國評論,Product worked great for about two weeks then one of the ears got water damaged due to sweat.
Jack Falter,1,No volume control on headset,2023年10月9日在美國評論,There is no volume control on the headset you have to control the volume for your phone who does that nowadays
Byron M. Grossnckle,5,Great set of headphones,2023年10月9日在美國評論,Better than the last set I owned (from a different company).  Plenty of volume and decent battery life.
Amazon Customer,4,Confortable and easy to use,2023年10月8日在美國評論,Confortable and easy to use.  Like it because can here music and at the same time be aware of my surroundings.
Maria Campbell,5,worked out of the box and had a good price,2023年10月8日在美國評論,It worked right out of the box.  it has a good sound and the battery life is good.
George Carr,4,Out of ear,2023年10月7日在美國評論,I like it but it's not good if there's a lot of noise outside because it makes it harder to hear it. But if you're cycling or need to be aware of your surroundings it's excellent
Dustin,5,Great price and reliability!,2023年10月7日在美國評論,Ordered these headphones for work and they work great!
Paul F Gardner,5,It works very well,2023年10月7日在美國評論,"Wrist easily on my head and it’s easy to carry around on my neck all during the day so when I went to listen to podcasts and things with other people present, I can do it easily"
Jamey,1,Done after 4 months,2023年11月8日在美國評論,"These headphones started giving me a beeping sound like they were running out of juice, even though they were at 90%. So something's broke and I keep hearing beeping noises along with my music. Not a fan."
Brittany A Hofstra,1,They do NOT last,2023年11月8日在美國評論,I purchased these two months ago and they have already quit working.  They will no longer accept a charge or turn on.  Of course it is outside of the return window.  Don't waste your money if you want a product that will last more than two months.
Sara Dykstra,3,Not pleased,2023年11月2日在美國評論,"Repeatedly kept shutting off by itself; also shut off completely over and over, and I’d have to turn it back on again - very annoying"
Rick,5,Sound is good,2023年10月30日在美國評論,"I wear these on my bicycle.  The sound is good while allowing you to hear cars, and people around you.  They are so comfortable I forget I have them on."
Amazon Customer,1,Trash,2023年10月29日在美國評論,Bad sizing and connection
Sylvia,1,Stopped working,2023年10月26日在美國評論,Worked great h til it doesn’t. Worked yesterday. Today it is dead. Unable to charge. No response. No lights or tones.  Doesn’t last but month.
courtney keller,4,Good for running,2023年10月24日在美國評論,"Great for the price point. They hardly move when running, sound can be a little off at times but adjusting the headphones usually fixes it."
Mama Bear 89,1,Quality is terrible,2023年10月24日在美國評論,"These are not loud enough at all, and are to wide to be worn by a child."
Keith,5,Great purchase!,2023年10月23日在美國評論,Great when you want to listen privately but need to hear what's going on around you. Glad I purchased them!
Mig,4,"Takes getting used to, other than that Great Sound!",2023年10月22日在美國評論,Hand down better switch from the “in-ear” earbuds  for the simple reason of being aware of your surroundings while listening to preferred tunes
ljhjr,3,Just works,2023年10月21日在美國評論,Works as advertised. Comfortable and adjustable. Impressive sound while still being able to hear your surroundings.
Jbear,1,Doesn't work,2023年10月21日在美國評論,"Worked 3 times. Now won't turn on. Unfortunately, I'm just outside of the return period."
MJM,4,Sound is clear & better than EarPods but small buttons big wire,2023年10月21日在美國評論,"I like to use this while walking the dog. It stays in place and I can hear clearly. The drawbacks for me include small buttons to figure out if it is off. I am never sure, I just move my iPhone out of range. The other area that is less than ideal,  is the wire. Apparently my head fits an average hat size but this has a bit of a gap. I am female with above shoulder length hair so I try to cover the gap in the back  and bring my hair over it. If I tucked hair under, I would have a wire showing. Guess that wouldn’t be a bad look but not my preferred style. Overall, I am enjoying this ear bone headphone. Earbuds kept falling out of my ears and headphones block all other noise. These work very well for walking."
Philly_PA,3,More Noise Enhancement than Noise cancellation,2023年10月21日在美國評論,"First & Foremost, they were easy on the budget. Feels comfortable, even when worn for long period of times. However, I have noticed headaches late in the evenings after wearing them most of the day. Battery doesn't last as long as the Named brand pair I previously used. I am getting 4-6 hours of music listening with occasional phone calls. When using these headphones and talking on the phone, the party on the other end of the phone, complains about excessive noise Ex: While driving w/windows closed, Other party says, it sounds like car windows are open and asks me to mute. Example 2: When hand washing dishes at home, the other party states, it sound like I am taking a shower. They sound clear for the person wearing them, but for the other party, I am often asked to mute my phone when not talking to manually reduce the noise. :-(  No way to check battery strength, adjust sound levels, bass or tone. Did I mention they were easy on the budget? Not sure if I would purchase again, purchased these in-between jobs. Will treat myself to another premium brand version during the holiday sales."
Amit Singla,4,Great tech but not adjustable for different size heads,2023年10月20日在美國評論,"The headphones are well-constructed.Solid product. I have PTSD and wearing in-ear or on-ear buds is uncomfortable. These open ear headphones have given me an easier way to listen to music, with clarity, while being an open-ear concept. I'm very impressed with the tech.Room for improvement:My only complaint is that lack of adjustibility of the rear band of the headphones. It makes it difficult to rest the back of your head and neck on a pillow bc the neck strap comes out too far and then displaces the speaker from your cheekbones.The only other annoyance is that when the headphones are turned on after being off, it will reconnect via Bluetooth automatically to every device in range that it has been paired with in the past. And it will make itself the primary audio output even if you had Bluetooth music already playing on another device. It's not an earth-shattering issue, but just a minor Bluetooth annoyance.In the future, I hope to see an adjustable neck strap version of these headphones.I would buy it instantly."
ricky704,1,Stopped working after 20uses (right after the 30 day return window),2023年10月20日在美國評論,"It was okay, slipped and slipped a lot during workouts, but it wasn't bad, however, it just stopped charging, it looks fine (no visible damage in charging port) just won't charge. Really disappointed."
Amazon Customer,5,Just perfect for listening to books!,2023年10月17日在美國評論,"I use this to listen to my audiobooks.  It works perfectly for me.  I was going to spend $100 on a bone induction one but decided to try this one first. Of course, the more expensive could br better, but this one works for me.Love, love, love!"
Logan Howell,5,Makes life easier and safer!,2023年10月17日在美國評論,"These bone conduction headphones are amazing, they make life safer. You can hear the outside world while using them so you're always aware of what's going on around you!"
Amazon Customer,5,Great sounds!,2023年10月17日在美國評論,"I absolutely love the over the ear bone conducting headphones! They are perfect, because I can still hear what’s going on around me and the music at the same time. A definite re-purchase if I ever lose them, or I want to give them as a gift!"
nheloverslie,5,Love it.,2023年10月17日在美國評論,I just received the items and I love it. Looks durable and I the bass is good. I test this for a while and I will buy again for my wife.
chad spencer,4,Good low cost Bluetooth,2023年10月5日在美國評論,Was bought for working out and works perfectly!
DC,5,Light weight,2023年10月5日在美國評論,Light weight good sound quality. I record podcasts to my mp3 player for my morning walks. Very pleased with this product.
oscar,4,Light,2023年10月5日在美國評論,
RICH,5,They work very well!  I bought another pair!,2023年10月5日在美國評論,Charges long and has great sound and volume!
Olivia Jaymes,5,Very comfy and I can still hear my surroundings,2023年10月5日在美國評論,
Amazon Customer,5,Good value.,2023年10月5日在美國評論,"Good sound. very comfortable to wear, does not fall off"
suchalady84,2,Does not fit.,2023年10月5日在美國評論,They worked as they should have but they do not fut my ears. They fall off with the slightest movement.
Rhonda B.,5,Working with hearing aids,2023年10月4日在美國評論,"Needed something to use with hearing aids,  this has been the answer!"

New buyer,4,Worth the buy,2023年10月3日在美國評論,Would recommend
Phil,5,"Comfortable, clear audio, and allow awareness of surroundings",2023年10月3日在美國評論,I.really appreciate that I don't have to put earbuds in my ear...the sound is clear...and I can still hear my surroundings
William Wier,5,Last all night long!,2023年10月3日在美國評論,"Good sound, decent fit, long lasting battery"
J. Thomas Black,5,Works as advertised - I use it to listen to music and audiobooks when walking,2023年10月2日在美國評論,"Music sounds the slightest bit tinny to me with these headphones, but for the price, they are fine. My regular Apple wired earphones have better sound but were always falling out of my ears and the wires were always getting in my way when walking. With these, the problem is solved. They wrap around your head and sit on top of your ears, so they are never in your way and never fall off."
PJ-Amazon Customer,5,Works great.,2023年10月2日在美國評論,Works as expected and has good battery life.
Becky Johnson,4,Hurts my ears a little,2023年10月2日在美國評論,"They seem a little bulky behind the ear. I wish there were a volume control on them, but they do sound good."
Caitlin Puent,2,Bad battery life,2023年10月2日在美國評論,Worked very well for the first few months then the battery life started going downhill. At best lasts 4 or 5 hrs now compared to the 7+ when I first got them. I fear in another month or two they will be trash.
runnerRubicon,5,Quality of sound,2023年10月1日在美國評論,The quality of sound is impressive and the device works as expected. I have experienced no issues with the Bluetooth connection.
Tim Baggett,4,,2023年10月1日在美國評論,
Angela M. Scholbrock,5,Works great,2023年10月1日在美國評論,Very comfortable and great sound quality. Battery also lasts all day!
Cindy E,5,Love it,2023年9月27日在美國評論,I like the fact that there is not actually anything in my ear and i find myself not having to adjust the volume
Frank Bonilla,5,Great head set. SAFE too!,2023年9月27日在美國評論,Keep your hearing of surrounding things and listen to your programs or music.
Regina,1,Did Not Work Returned,2023年9月27日在美國評論,"I received and I charged battery immediately. I turned device on and connected to iPhone Bluetooth, I turned on music and sound only came from one side of device. I done several trouble shooting tries still no sound on one side. I returned for refund no problem."
Katrina,5,Very nice,2023年9月27日在美國評論,Nice design and fit perfectly.

Alvaro,5,Cómodo y buen producto,2023年9月26日在美國評論,"Es justo el producto que pedí y necesitaba, creo que tiene una buena calidad de sonido, y muy buena estabilidad a la hora de hacer ejercicio. Es un producto cómodo y fácil de llevar."
Shamberg,2,Not adjustable,2023年9月26日在美國評論,The most important thing to note for this item especially for men and people with larger heads: you can not extend the headset to go further back; would not recommend for that reason
Carson,1,"Too small, too quiet",2023年9月26日在美國評論,You get what you pay for. The quality of these is poor. They are bulky and poorly designed. They are too small to fit around the back of your head properly. The conductors do not rest naturally on your cheekbone but instead on your ear opening. They seem like traditional headphones trying to be bone conducting headphones. The volume is too quiet even with my phone turned all the way up. Returning these.
Randy K,5,Great product,2023年9月26日在美國評論,"I can’t say I have any complaints, they’re comfortable, I can hear both my music and general surroundings in a busy warehouse environment. (can clearly hear someone trying to get my attention, have to pause to have a conversation but that might just be me) Great product!"
Buen producto,4,Buen Producto,2023年9月26日在美國評論,"Buen producto, útil para su utilización."
adam read,5,Works well,2023年9月25日在美國評論,"I really enjoy these headphones. I drop my first pair and they got ran over. Still plays, just messed up. Bought a second pair. I take them everywhere."

dondi,4,Easy to use,2023年9月25日在美國評論,Easy to pair. The sound is very good. I didn’t think I would hear the speakers as well as I do because of where they sit. The sound is clear.
Meagan Neill Cole,4,Great product for the price,2023年9月25日在美國評論,I use these for running on the road and I can hear everything around me as well as my music. They have been great and have a really long battery life.
D-Money,5,Shokz knockoff,2023年9月25日在美國評論,After wrecking one pair of shokz and losing another thought I'd save some money and bought these Wigfar versions and I must say I'm impressed they sound awesome connected right up to my cell phone used them in the rain used them at work only charged the once so far and they just keep on keeping on best thing about bone conduction earphones are you can stay aware of your surroundings and still hear your music overall a lot safer. If you ever want to get the full special audio effect just plug your ears and your head will be full of sound
cedric MaeWeathers,5,Awesome,2023年9月25日在美國評論,Better than expected
Amazon Customer,3,These are alright,2023年10月1日在美國評論,Not super comfortable and they don't adjust well. Sound quality is good and the battery lasts. Guess you get what you pay for.
Stormy Hunter,5,Light weight and flexible,2023年9月30日在美國評論,Very light weight and flexible. I like that I can wear these instead of worrying about earbuds falling out while jogging or walking.

Dave Gaston,5,Great quality,2023年9月28日在美國評論,I have only just got these and so far the sound is great. I don't think that for the price you will find a better pair. The quality feels like a higher priced product.
Amazon Customer,5,Love!!!,2023年9月28日在美國評論,"Love the open ear concept, love that it isn’t in my ear which I think is uncomfortable would buy again."

justin landis,3,Ok for quiet spaces,2023年9月28日在美國評論,"I bought these to use on bicycle rides, however they do not put enough energy out to be heard outside of office environments.I took a chance on budget and got what I paid for."
Rich,5,Perfect for fitness,2023年9月28日在美國評論,Perfect for my workouts! I wasn’t able to be aware of my surroundings with traditional ear bud style headphones. Plus these stay secure!
Connie Hayes,5,Love these bone conduction headphones!,2023年9月28日在美國評論,I love how easy they are to use!
Pedro Cortez,4,Decent but could be better,2023年9月28日在美國評論,"Bought these for ASMR and Binaural frequency listening..they work great if you done lean your head on stuff or lay down on your bed. They wrap around the back of your head and that part is too long, it would be nice if the band part was adjustable. Overall for what I wanted them for they do the job pretty well. They feel great, you can still listen to your environment and the sound isn’t effected, and the battery last really long which is also major plus."
Stacey Graham,5,Perfect for jogging!,2023年9月27日在美國評論,"Love that I can still hear my surroundings, but also enjoy my music!"
